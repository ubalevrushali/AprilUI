                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) describes the HTML elements which are displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It saves a lot of time. It controls the layout of multiple web pages at one time. It sets the font-size, font-family, color, background color on the page.
                        It allows us to add effects or animations to the website. We use CSS to display animations like buttons, effects, loaders or spinners, and also animated backgrounds.
                        Without using CSS, the website will not look attractive. 
                        
                        There are 3 types of CSS which are below:
                        1.Inline CSS
                        2.Internal/ Embedded CSS
                        3.External CSS

                        CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It describes to the user how to display HTML elements on the screen in a proper format. CSS is the language that is used to style HTML documents. In simple words, cascading style sheets are a language used to simplify the process of making a webpage.
                        CSS is used to handle some parts of the webpage. With the help of CSS, we can control the colour of text and style of fonts, and we can control the spacing between the paragraph and many more things. CSS is easy to understand but provides strong control on the Html documents.CSS is combined with HTML.
                        The CSS provides the style to the HTML element, which the browser interprets. After being interpreted by the browser, the CSS style property will be applied to all the elements of the HTML. We can provide style property to the HTML element in three parts.
